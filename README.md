# RMI-INDUCTION-2019

THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS THE FILES OF THE PROJECTS That I did for RMI Club Inductions, The robotics research and development club of NITT. 

My field of specialization being Opencv, I did projects on the following:
- Trajectory tracking under occluded environments.
- object speed,distance calculation in realtime.
- Paint software features using OpenCV: https://youtu.be/-dyv4-4FIzo

I have also did tasks in the field of:
- mechanics
- electronics
- arduino coding and mini projects
- algorithms
